    <h1>Mental Health</h1>
    <h2>What are Mental Health Problems?</h2>
    <p>Mental health problems encompass a vast spectrum of conditions that profoundly influence an individuals emotional, psychological, and social well-being, thereby affecting how they think, feel,
        and interact with others on a daily basis. These conditions manifest in diverse forms, ranging from anxiety disorders-where individuals might experience ongoing, uncontrollable worry and fear-to
         mood disorders, such as depression, characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a diminished interest in activities that once brought fulfillment and joy. It is important for us to 
        show recognition and to show acts of altruism around these people. There reaction may not be prompt or conspicuous, but I can assure you that they genuinely appreciate you feeling sympathy for them.
